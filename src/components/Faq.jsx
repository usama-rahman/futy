                  WhatsApp Business is a second WhatsApp app on your phone, for
                  your business WhatsApp conversations. Link a landline
                  telephone number to WhatsApp by verifying your number in the
                  app via a telephone code.

              <div className=" text-[.9375rem] leading-[1.8em] ">
                <p>
                  It is possible to change your subscription at any time . When
                  you upgrade to a higher package, any previous payments will be
                  automatically deducted from the total amount. So if you have
                  paid for a year in advance and then want to upgrade, you only
                  have to pay the difference.

                  This can be done by linking Futy with Calendly . Synchronize
                  your calendar and let your website visitors schedule a (video)

                  After someone has made a request via your website, an email is
                  sent from Futy. In the Standard & Business package, you can
                  set a signature for these emails. See an example here .

                  If you want to stop, you can cancel your subscription with one
                  push of a button in the account (under the heading Company
                  details). We do not work with a notice period. If you want to
                  stop, you can do so with immediate effect. Your account will
                  then remain valid for the period for which you paid.

                  Together with an assigned account manager, you can set it up
                  so that the Leadbot fits perfectly with your target group,
                  business and website.
